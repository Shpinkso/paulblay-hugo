&lt;p&gt;At the points in my career that I have seen senior management push back on the adoption of agile methodologies, the main areas of contention has been around the feeling of losing “control” over the delivery roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The ugly side of no surprises management</title><link>https://paulblay.com/blog/2019/01/05/ugly_side_no_surprises/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2019 11:46:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://paulblay.com/blog/2019/01/05/ugly_side_no_surprises/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I get it… I think…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No Surprises” management is intended to ensure that people aren’t hiding bad news from their colleagues (let’s face it, usually their boss or some other superior) so that we’re not horribly surprised at the last minute that, for example, our project is 6 months late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boom! Instant high-functioning team! Everyone feels safe and surprises never happen…. Or at least, god help you if they still do happen, because I was very clear that I don’t like surprises! What don’t you understand? There isn’t an article on the whole internet that disagrees… Welcome to success-ville.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Autonomous teams vs 'resource' management</title><link>https://paulblay.com/blog/2018/10/10/autonomous_vs_resource/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 11:46:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://paulblay.com/blog/2018/10/10/autonomous_vs_resource/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;How often have you heard the phrase “We don’t have the resource” or “How many resources will it take?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite apart from the dehumanising nature of the word “resource” (should we, in response, say “that’s a good question, management resource number 3”?), people are not automatons who are all equally skilled/motivated coding machines that can be assumed to be equally effective in all scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People each have unique skills, ways of working, areas of experience, interests and relationships with others that all matter heavily in terms of getting the best results, or getting anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Motivation 2.0</title><link>https://paulblay.com/blog/2018/07/09/motivation_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jul 2018 11:46:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://paulblay.com/blog/2018/07/09/motivation_2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;How are you engaging your team? Are you running a regular appraisal cycle where everyone’s individual score is totted up and ultimately dictates financial reward (pay increase, bonus, share options) or, on the other side of the scale, performance improvement plans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you finding this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do people who get the financial rewards become more engaged and effective throughout the year? Do those on the performance improvement plans “pull their socks up” and become superstars now that they know they’re not performing to expectations?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
