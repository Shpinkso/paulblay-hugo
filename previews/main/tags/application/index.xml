I rarely use the LLM output directly because it never feels complete or authentic. For written word, I find it can generate pretty generic wording with little impact or personality.
Anything I do take directly, I&amp;rsquo;ll rework pretty heavily - and it&amp;rsquo;s just a judgement of whether doing the rework is more efficient than just starting from scratch.</description></item><item><title>Aligning Teams With Outcomes - A Product Application</title><link>https://shpinkso.github.io/paulblay-hugo/previews/main/blog/2025/10/13/applying_outcomes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 11:37:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://shpinkso.github.io/paulblay-hugo/previews/main/blog/2025/10/13/applying_outcomes/</guid><description>From experience I know that great ideas are only as valuable as their applications in the real world.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used OKRs and Outcome framing for quite a while, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time to showcase a real world example - what it did for us and what we learned.
I&amp;rsquo;ll present this in the classic STAR format like I&amp;rsquo;m trying to answer an interview question&amp;hellip; because that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending time doing recently.</description></item></channel></rss>
