      <description>An agilist, a people person and an unashamed nerd.&#xA;I have experienced working in large bureaucracies and lean startups, as a developer, people manager, project manager and product manager.&#xA;I’ve seen &amp;rsquo;exciting and dynamic&amp;rsquo; as well as &amp;lsquo;domineering and draining&amp;rsquo; cultures. Coupling this experience with plenty of ideas from excellent books, media and a network of colleagues turned friends; I hope to bring these learnings to this website in an easily consumable way.</description>

      <description>If you’re interested in a way to tap into your team or companies creative potential, generating alignment and delivering tangible value, then OKRs should be your first port of call.&#xA;I was fortunate enough to have met, and worked closely with Ragan McGill while I was at DisplayLink. Ragan had experienced both effective and underwhelming use of OKRs in his career and gave a set of training on how to ensure that they are well formed and deliver on their potential.</description>

      <title>Introducing the OKR ScoreCard</title>

      <description>So let’s assume we’re using OKRs now. We’ve come up with some Objectives and tried to find meaningful measures for our Key Results that we think will help us ensure we’re going in the right direction.&#xA;It’s important to remind ourselves that OKRs are just a tool. Using an ORK framework doesn’t necessarily ensure that we’re getting any tangible benefits over any other approach.&#xA;For example, the next two OKR examples for our imaginary TownTalk ™ product both provide an objective and measurable KRs against it, but do both really unlock the same value?</description>

      <description>If you’ve ever worked for a business that has it’s core focus in the embedded software space, I suspect you are more likely to have had to tolerate software development practices from 20 years ago. If you’ve read many books on Agile software development, DevOps or other modern practices, you may also have noticed that they almost all talk about software that targets a server or website, possibly a PC. But unless you’re reading a very different library to me, you’ll not have seen much talk about embedded software.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.&#xA;This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Books, videos and other content that I highly recommend.&#xA;Books Radical Candor Kim Scott does an exceptional job of taking the reader through the why and how of direct, upfront conversation. This is such a critical leadership skill. The book is easy to consume and will change the way you think about how you talk to people not just in a work setting, but in any valuable relationship.&#xA;A Seat At The Table How do you add value as a CTO in the age of agility, autonomous teams and cradle to grave ownership?</description>
