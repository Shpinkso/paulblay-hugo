If you’ve read many books on Agile software development, DevOps or other modern practices, you may also have noticed that they almost all talk about software that targets a server or website, possibly a PC. But unless you’re reading a very different library to me, you’ll not have seen much talk about embedded software. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>what is agility?</title><link>https://paulblay.com/blog/2017/02/03/what_is_agility/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2017 11:46:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://paulblay.com/blog/2017/02/03/what_is_agility/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, ‘agile’ is an adjective, a descriptive word… like “nimble” &amp;amp; so the more obvious title “What is agile?” probably would have made a small, hardcore, fraction of people up-chuck a little in their mouths. (I am not so offended on this one, but tell me something is “addicting” and I will develop an unruly lower eyelid twitch). I think the reason behind this is due to how commercialised and corporate the term has become over the years – ironically, as the original manifesto moved thinking in a completely different direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
