![Me](/img/me.jpg)

---

An agilist, a people person and an unashamed nerd.

I have experienced working in large bureaucracies and lean startups, as a developer, people manager, project manager and product manager.

I’ve seen 'exciting and dynamic' as well as 'domineering and draining' cultures. Coupling this experience with plenty of ideas from excellent books, media and a network of colleagues turned friends; I hope to bring these learnings to this website in an easily consumable way.

I hope it’s useful to you!
