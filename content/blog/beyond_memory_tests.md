I chose the old photo banner art (Photo by [Debby Hudson](https://unsplash.com/@hudsoncrafted?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)) because most of my recent interviews have felt more like a memory test than a copetancy test.

> "Tell me about a time a family member gave you some advice, what was it and how did your life change as a result? Did you send them a thankyou card? What was on the card?"

Yikes, I don't remember!

... Ironically, I also **do** remember - but I remember lots of advice over many years, all fairly vaguely, but all contributed to who I am and what I do today... which is the best one to try and dig up the details for?

Inevitably, I just reach for the most recent example, because I remember the most about it. It might not be a very relevant one though. Oh dear

> "Hi Paul, just some feedback from the interview - the team didn't think your answer to the family advice question was what they were looking for. They think maybe you haven't been close enough to your family compared to other candidates."

... the analagy is getting a bit stretched. :smiley:

Candidates could, of course, prep for a selection of potential likely questions. Here are [more than 60](https://www.themuse.com/advice/interview-questions-and-answers) common questions that don't even touch on your specialism, I'd argue you could find a factor of 10 more for specialism related questions, which is an unrealistic amount of prep - even assuming we could remember enough details of examples from years ago while prepping.

I've talked mostly about losing out in the interview process so far, but I've also experienced interviews where I was lucky enough to have recently worked very closely with the topics and questions posed, so got the job. I was aware at the time that if the questions had focussed on some other technical aspect that I hadn't worked so closely on and so recently, that I would have had a much harder time recalling the information.

So let's see if we can tackle this...

## The challenge

### The Current State:

* Interviews reward time-boxed memory recollection skills.

* Candidates are rewarded for clarity under pressure, story polish, and recall of anecdotes over deep expertise.

* People who tend to think deply before speaking, or who use techniques to assist memory that aren't available to them in interviews, can find themselves penalised.

* We optimise for “smooth talkers” over “systems thinkers.”

### Desired state:

* A process that measures competence, judgement, self-awareness, and learning habits.

* One that values thoughtfulness and humility as evidence of deep understanding.

* One that compensates for memory degradation by changing the format and time horizon of the evaluation.
