I chose the old photo banner art (Photo by [Debby Hudson](https://unsplash.com/@hudsoncrafted?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)) because most of my recent interviews have felt more like a memory test than a copetancy test.

> "Tell me about a time a family member gave you some advice, what was it and how did your life change as a result? Did you send them a thankyou card? What was on the card?"

Yikes, I don't remember!

... Ironically, I also **do** remember - but I remember lots of advice, all fairly vaguely... which is the best one to try and dig up the details for?

Inevitably, I just reach for the most recent example, because I remember the most about it. It might not be a very good one though.
