From experience I know that great ideas are only as valuable as their applications in the real world.

I've used OKRs and Outcome framing for quite a while, so it's about time to showcase a real world example - what it did for us and what we learned.

I'll present this in the classic STAR format like I'm trying to answer an interview question... because that's what I've been spending time doing recently. üòÉ

# Situation

I'm being moved into the NPI (New Product Introductions) group as the lead. The group consists of three teams of engineers, with product owners and QA spread across the teams. 

The group just came out of a failed multi-year effort to develop a new product and were suffering from burnout.

Marketing were seen as the enemy, teams had little autonomy and complained of regularly being asked to perform miracles, releases were rare and difficult.
All focus recently had been on generating demos for trade shows to show off a new platform, resulting in demo-ware that was had to extend and customers couldn't actually use.

Work was fed into the team via dictate, partly due to a lack of ownership over a new plan.

Here's the odd thing - the teams had some of the best engineers in the building. The marketing representation was also very knowledgable and customer focussed. This was absolutely a fixable state.

# Task

There were a lot of actions taken to try and get things into shape, including: Organisational design, role clarification, building relationships, adapting process, etc - but here I'm just going to detail the switch from task focus to outcome focus.

The task at hand was to define an objective with inputs from 

# Action

# Result

# Lessons Learned

### Key Result Scoring
Out of ten, score:
- Is ‚Äúrealised‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù
- I would consider reaching this as a significant aspect of the objective complete

Then apply multipliers:
- Is numerical: Yes (2), No (1)
- Measurability: Is measurable now (2), Could be measured with some work (1), Cannot be measured directly (0)
- Represents a change in customer behaviour: Yes (2), No (1)
- Distribution over OKR lifetime:
  - Even distribution (2)
  - Front/back loaded (0.5)
  - Single event / after lifetime (0)
- Multiple paths to achievement: Yes (1), No (0)
